# Sync Modes

## Full sync

Full syncing works by downloading and executing every block from genesis. This means that full syncing will only work for networks that started after [The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/), as ethrex only supports post merge execution.

## Snap sync

For snap sync, you can view the [main document here](./snap_sync.md).
